    "K-means clustering is a simple unsupervised machine-learning method for cluster analysis. The aim of the method is to partition a set of points into _k_ clusters, such that each point in the data is assigned to the nearest cluster. The algorithm iterates through two steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Assign each data point to the cluster with the nearest centroid\n",
    "2. Update the centroids of the clusters given the new partition of the data across the clusters\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm converges (finishes running) when the assignments to clusters no longer change. Since the intial assignment to clusters is (mostly) random, there is no guarantee that the optimum assignment is found. So it is common to run the algorithm multiple times and use different starting conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we will implement a **much** simplified version of the k-means clustering algorithm. Rather than running the algorithm until convergence, we will repeat the above two steps a large but fixed number of times. In addition, we will initialize only once, using a naive method according to which we randomly choose k points from the data to use as initial cluster centroids. \n",
    "\n",
    "In real life, there are plenty of libraries that allow you to implement this algorithm, and these account for much more complexity than we are going to here (such as the [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.cluster.KMeans.html)), but this should give an idea of the intuition behind this process. Understanding this can also be very helpful for understanding how cross-validation works in machine learning (related but different idea).\n",
    "\n",
    "For this example, we can use the `Wholesale customers data.csv`, which you can find in the repository. The file contains information on the annual spending on diverse product categories for the clients of a wholesale distributor. The data are obtained from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php) and you can find more information about them [here](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Wholesale+customers#).\n"
