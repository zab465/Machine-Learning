# Machine-Learning


## Content

In this repository, you will find some basic machine learning algorithms and how to implement them from scratch! 

So far, the ones covered in here include: 

* K-means clustering
* K-Nearest Neighbors (binary classifier)
* A network of Wikipedia reverts (in Romania)

_Note_: we here construct the network of reverts between authors on Wikipedia and explore a social theory of competition between most similar individuals.
