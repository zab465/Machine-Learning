    "In this notebook, we will study reverts on Wikipedia. A revert can be understood as the event when an editor undoes the changes made by another editor (this is different from adding to what the other authors did). We will first identify who reverted whom and when, then identify situations in which if $A$ reverted $B$, $B$ reverted $A$ within 24 hours, and finally, study the difference in seniority between $A$ and $B$.\n",

Each line in the file is an edit and includes the title of the edited article, the time when the edit was submitted, whether the edit was a revert, the version of the article, and the user who submitted the edit. To detect the article versions, a hash was calculated for the complete article text following each revision and the hashes were compared between edits. \n",

    "### 1. Who reverted whom?\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we will create a network (e.g., an edge list), where an edge goes from the editor who restored an earlier version of the article (the \"reverter\") to the editor who made the revision immediately after that version (the \"reverted\"). For every edge, we will keep track of who the reverter was, who got reverted, when the revert occurred, and what the \"seniority\" of the the reverter and the reverted were at this point in time. Seniority here is the number of edits that the editor in question made up until that point. \n",
    "\n",
    "We will ignore the article titles for the analyses so we don't have to save this. To make things a little easier, we will also avoid self-reverts (when an author reverts his own version of the article).\n",
    "\n",
    "We will estimate seniority $s_i$ of editor $i$ as the base-ten logarithm of the number of edits $i$ has completed by the time of the revert under question. Transforming the number of edits with the logarithm makes sense because they follow a power-law distribution (the majority of individuals have very few edits, while a handful of individuals are responsible for most of the work). This operationalization allows to express the difference in seniority between two editors as the base-ten logarithm of the ratio of number of edits since $s_i - s_j = \\log_{10} e_i - \\log_{10} e_j = \\log_{10} \\frac{e_i}{e_j}$, where $e_i$ is the number of edits of editor $i$ and $e_j$ is the number of edits of editor $j$. In essence, we assume that an editor who has 10 edits compares to one with 100 edits the same way that an editor with 1,000 edits compares to one with 10,000.\n",

Imagine that you were doing a really long project and using different functions that are unrelated to each other, you want to be able to access these quickly by importing them from the relevant module, without overloading your memory with a bunch of functions you don't need!

The aim is to identify the two-event sequence in which after $A$ reverts $B$, $B$ reverts $A$ back ($AB–BA$) within 24 hours. To identify these sequences, use the revert data from the previous task. We will ignore the article titles — we are agnostic as to whether the response happens in the same or in different articles.
